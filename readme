entro.py

***

This script is intended to provide a way for security researchers to generate a large number of passwords based off of a person's personal info. This script should never be used for illegal purposes such as unauthorized password cracking. 

***

How it works:
Takes a text file of words assosciated with a person (default is ./words.txt) and a text file of numbers assosciated with a person (default is ./numbers.txt) and generates a text wordlist (default is ./wordlist.txt).

Usage: entro.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -w [FILE]      specify words text file [default is ./words.txt]
  -n [FILE]      specify numbers text file [default is ./numbers.txt]
  -o [FILE]      specify output text file [default is ./wordlist.txt]
  -m MIN_LENGTH  specify minimum password length [default is 0]
  -e             eliminates exclamation points from passwords
