entro.py


***


This script is intended to provide a way for security researchers to generate a large number of passwords based off of a person's personal info. This script should never be used for illegal purposes such as unauthorized password cracking. 


***


How it works:
Takes a text file of words assosciated with a person (default is ./words.txt) and a text file of numbers assosciated with a person (default is ./numbers.txt) and generates a text wordlist (default is ./wordlist.txt).

For the math nerds, this script generates (n+1)27w^2+(n+1)3w+n passwords, without exclamation points.
